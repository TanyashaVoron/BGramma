Thank you for your letter! I will answer your questions about my family with pleasure. Today is Sunday, so we are all together. It is raining, that's why we are all sitting in the living room. My Mom is reading. She is a teacher of literature, so she reads a lot. She is a slim woman of about 40. Her pupils like her for she is an easy going and a kind person. Reading is her hobby. Besides, she is fond of cooking.
